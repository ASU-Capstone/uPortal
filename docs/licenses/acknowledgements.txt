The uPortal distribution may include a number of other libraries, resources, and products.  Intellectual property.  
This folder exists for two reasons.  The first reason is that we'd like to acknowledge the important contributions 
these other projects and resources make to our project.  The success of this project has been and continues to be dependent upon
the quality tools and resources produced by others in the Java community.

Some of these projects and resources we include in our distribution are subject to license agreements.  
The second reason for this folder is to provide a place in the distribution where we include the other files necessary for
our distribution to comply with the terms of these agreements.

We have attempted here to comply with applicable license agreements and give credit where credit is due. If we have overlooked
acknowledgement of any contribution to this project please bring this to our attention.
