website/user            o Documentation for end users.

There are also several other documents in the website directory including 
FAQ page, bug reporting, licensing, etc.

Deploying 
---------

The documentation may be deployed into the uPortal deployment directory
or to a web server.  By default files are copied to the docs subdirectory
of the uPortal deploy.home directory defined in the build.properties file
in the uPortal release directory.  To change the location modify the 
doc.deploy.home property in the build.xml file.  For example, to deploy 
the documentation to a web site running under Apache change the property
to something like /usr/local/apache/html/uportal.

Note: the deploy target will append the "docs" directory to the deployment
home.

The following ant command will deploy the documentation:

  ant deploy


About HSQLDB
------------

Using an older version of hsqldb.jar with another version of the HSQLDB server could cause uPortal to hang.
See hsqldb.jar's entry in build.xml for documentation of exactly what version of hsqldb.jar is included with this release.
