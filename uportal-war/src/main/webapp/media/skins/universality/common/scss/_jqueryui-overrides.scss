  jQuery UI overrides.
------------------------------------ 
 * uPortal uses jQuery UI (http://jqueryui.com/) for animation, effects, and widgets.
 * jQuery UI themes are expected by uPortal to format jQuery UI elements used by the portal.
 * The specific jQuery UI theme used in this skin is specified in skin.xml
 * A default theme (smoothness) is available from the resource server.
 * Alternate themes can be used by changing the reference in skin.xml
 * These are any overrides to the jQuery UI theme.
