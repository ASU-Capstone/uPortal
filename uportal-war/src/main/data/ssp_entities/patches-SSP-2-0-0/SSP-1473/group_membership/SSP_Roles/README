You'll need to import
{src-root}/uportal-war/src/main/data/ssp_entities/group_membership/SSP_Roles/SSP_Roles.group-membership.xml
as well. Otherwise the new group introduced by this patch (SSP_MAP_TEMPLATE_ADMIN)
will not appear under the SSP Roles top-level group in the uP Group Management
portlet. Unfortunately, we cannot just include a file here in the patch
defining an incremental change to that file. The importer handles it with
"replace" semantics and the order of file processing across all patches is
not defined.
