<h2>What is uPortal?</h2>

portal platform developed and maintained by participants drawn from across higher education 
under the coordination of <a href="http://www.ja-sig.org" target="_blank">JASIG</a>. uPortal can aggregate 
content, present self-service applications, personalize 
presentation and content on the basis of groups and user attributes, and allow advanced
