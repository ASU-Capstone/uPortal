# Spring pseudo-URL pointing to a Groovy implementation of IPersonAttributesFilter
# suitable for filtering person directory lookups for end users hitting the
# portal via the /sso API. OOTB options:
#
#   classpath:org/jasig/portal/portlets/lookup/NoOpPersonAttributesFilter.groovy - Default. Does nothing.
#
#   classpath:org/jasig/portal/portlets/lookup/RequiredBaseDnPersonAttributesFilter.groovy - Limits directory search
#      results to only those persons associated with the baseDn configured by an additional property set in this
#      file. E.g. to limit SSO to users in the 'faculty' branch of an imaginary LDAP directory:
#
#        environment.build.sso.personFilteringBaseDn=ou=faculty,o=persondir
#
#      For this to work, personDirectoryContext.xml DAOs must be configured to expose a logical attribute named
#      'distinguishedName'

#   classpath:org/jasig/portal/portlets/lookup/PreferredBaseDnPersonAttributesFilter.groovy - Similar to
#      RequiredBaseDnPersonAttributesFilter but allows results not associated with
#      environment.build.sso.personFilteringBaseDn. I.e. if an end user has multiple directory entries with the same
#      environment.build.sso.personDirectoryUuidAttributeName (see below) and that attribute is being used as the
#      lookup key, choose the entry associated with environment.build.sso.personFilteringBaseDn, if any. Otherwise
#      return all results (which may result in an error downstream). Use this is you want to allow SSO for
#      users in a variety of base DNs, but need a policy for narrowing down entries for certain users.
#
# If none of these strategies work for your deployment, you can define a custom strategy without forking Platform
# source by defining your Groovy-implemented IPersonAttributesFilter anywhere that can be referenced by a Spring
# pseudo-URL. If you define a file: URL, changes to the script will be picked up automatically without requiring
# an app server restart. E.g.:
#
#  environment.build.sso.personFilteringScript=file:/opt/sspconfig/MyPersonAttributesFilter.groovy
#
environment.build.sso.personFilteringScript=classpath:org/jasig/portal/portlets/lookup/NoOpPersonAttributesFilter.groovy

# Specifies the person attribute name which PreferredBaseDnPersonAttributesFilter will treat as a unique directory
# identifier for a real-world human being. E.g. if a human has mulitple accounts in the directory, this attribute
# indicates that they are all related to that same human. This property really only exists to ensure
# PreferredBaseDnPersonAttributesFilter does not contain hard-coded SSP behaviors and thus should never need to be
# modified for SSP deployments.

# For the JVM-local SsoTicketService API. This
# typically needs to match a corresponding config in
# the SSP webapp. See portal.properties for more info.
