#
# Modify this file to suit your environment.
# The values of these properties will
# override the values of properties of the
# same name in the build.xml file.
#
# Use forward slashes for path names even if
# you are in a Windows environment!
#


#==================== File and Directory Names ========================

##### Replace server.home with the location of Tomcat 6 on your machine #####
# path to tomcat binaries
server.home=@server.home@

# path to tomcat servlet container (defaults to same directory as the tomcat binaries)
server.base=${server.home}

# path to webapps directory (defaults to /webapps under the tomcat path)
server.webapps=${server.base}/webapps

# If the mvn executable isn't on your path you can set the location here or set it on your path.
#maven.home=

######## uPortal Data ######## 

# Use entities.location to override the location of data imported by the initdb 
# and/or db-import targets;  required data is imported before entities specified here
#entities.location=uportal-impl/src/main/resources/properties/db/entities/

######## Deployment Configuration ##########
# The following apply to deployPortletApp, deploy-war, and deploy-ear targets

# Should the deployment tools extract the WARs when copying them into the servlet container 
extractWars=true

# Should the existing webapp be removed before deploying the new webapp
removeExisting=true

# The following applies to the clean and deploy-ear targets.
# Should the shared library location have all existing files removed when clean is run.
# NOTE: Tomcat 6.0 does not include any libraries in shared/lib by default so as long as
#       all required libraries are declared in the uportal-ear it is ok to set this to true.
cleanShared=false

# Prompt the user before running ant tasks that could modify the database
prodPrompt=false

#==================== Maven Filtering ========================
# You can use this file to manage environment-specific settings and supply them 
# to the appropriate locations at build time.  This process uses a Maven feature 
# called "Filtering" (http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-filtering/).
#
# Place filter tokens for environment-specific settings in configuration files, 
# then provide values for those tokens below.  NOTE:  Files with filter tokens 
# MUST be listed in the <includes> section for filtering in the appropriate 
# pom.xml file.

# Use 'filters.file' to override the location of the properties file for 
# Maven filtering.  The specified location should be a RELATIVE PATH.  If not 
#specified, this file (build.properties or build.{env}.properties) will be used.
#filters.file=filters/prod.properties

## EXAMPLES ##

## Database Connection Settings (Uncomment the Maven Filters section in rdbm.properties)
#environment.build.hibernate.connection.driver_class=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
#environment.build.hibernate.connection.url=jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost:8887
#environment.build.hibernate.connection.username=sa
#environment.build.hibernate.connection.password=
#environment.build.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect
