Upgrading:

While your current channels and theme transforms will work unchanged in uPortal 2.5.1 if they worked in 2.5.0, 
transforms require minor changes and channels potentially major changes to take advantage of dynamic 
channel titles.  CTimeTitle and the changes to the ALM / Integration Modes theme transform provide an example.

RDBMServices changed to stop declaring some SQLExceptions it would never throw.  Code catching those exceptions
will no longer compile (compile will fail with an unreachable catch block error).  Fixing this is trivial:
remove the unreachable catch blocks.



Major new features and improvements in this release:

Dynamic channel titles: now channels can specify at runtime their desired title, instead of just using 
a title configured at the time of channel publication.  CPortletAdapter needs enhancement to take advantage of this
feature to present dynamic portlet titles as dynamic channel titles.

Support for multiple stats recorders.
Inherent threadsafety of SoftHashMap.
And many more minor enhancements.



Bug fixes in this release:

Reduction of excessive object creation.
Threadsafety of system cache.
And many more minor bug fixes.
