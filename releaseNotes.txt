Release notes for uPortal 2.5.3 General Audience
(the general audience release of uPortal 2.5.3):

SVN branch:     2-5-export
Online Notes:   http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/UPC/2.5-export.1


*************** This release cannot be used to run uPortal ***************


This release can be configured with your existing uPortal 2.5 configuration
files and then used to export your database into a format that can be imported
into uPortal 3.0 and later.



##### Unsupported Data

The following data cannot be automatically exported for use in uPortal 3:
    * Aggregated Layout Manager (ALM) fragments
    * Groups that don't have unique names (i.e. two or more groups have the
      same name)


##### Usage
   1. Download and extract the release
   2. Configure the uPortal-2.5-export.0 project as your current uPortal 2.5.x
      project is configured. This generally includes the following files:
         1. properties/rdbm.properties
         2. properties/ldap.properties or properties/ldap.xml if LDAP is used
         3. properties/dlm.xml
         4. properties/groups/*
         5. properties/personDirectory.xml or properties/PersonDirs.xml
         6. properties/portal.properties
   3. Run the command ant -f import-export.xml export -Ddir=exportDataDir -Dtype=all

The export task will compile the uPortal code, connect to the portal database
configured in rdbm.properties and export all portal data. The exported data 
will be in such a format that uPortal 3.0 is the minimum compatible version to
import the data into.
