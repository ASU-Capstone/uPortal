/**
 * PersonDirectory is a static lookup mechanism for a singleton instance of 
 * IPersonAttributeDao.  It is configurable via a
 * Spring beans.dtd compliant configuration file in the properties directory
 * called personDirectory.xml (as referenced by applicationContext.xml -
 * that is, you could choose to declare the underlying IPersonAttributesDao
 * backing your PersonDirectory directly in applicationContext.xml, 
 * or elsewhere. PersonDirectory looks for an IPersonAttributeDao instance 
 * named 'personAttributeDao'.
 * 
 * This class serves as the lookup mechanism for clients to obtain a reference
 * to the singleton IPersonAttributeDao instance.  Via legacy methods, 
 * PersonDirectory also serves as the interface by which client
 * code accesses user attributes.  These deprecated legacy methods are a facade
 * to the PersonAttributeDao.
 * 
 * The default configuration of that file implements the legacy behavior of using
 * the PersonDirs.xml file for configuration.  It is expected that PersonDirs.xml
 * offers the flexibility necessary to support most uPortal installations.
